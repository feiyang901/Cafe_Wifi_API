# Cafe_Wifi_API
Building a full REST API from scratch using Flask.
Many companies have collected valuable data e.g. Bitcoin prices, Restaurant reviews and provide an API for developers to access this data for a price. Depending on how valuable the data/service is behind the API, these APIs can charge anywhere from $9 to $99 per month for access. Some even charge per API call.

What if you have access to some information that other people might want to use? E.g. You collected data on all the cafes in a particular city and figured out which ones were suitable for remote-work? Then you could create an API and charge people to access your data.

That's what I'll tackle in this project. I have built a full REST API from scratch using Flask. It's a API about all the cafes in London, the parameters of a cafe include name, map_url, img_url, location, has_sockets, has_toilet, has_wifi, can_take_calls, seats, and coffee_price. I hope people can find most suitble cafe for remote-work by access my API.
